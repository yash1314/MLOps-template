# Industry-Grade MLOps Template

Welcome to the Industry-Grade MLOps Template repository. This template is designed to kickstart your Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) projects with a structured and organized layout. It's equipped with essential folders, files, and best practices to streamline the development, training, and deployment of machine learning models.

## Repository Structure

The template follows a well-organized structure for your MLOps projects:

- **venv/**: Python virtual environment. This is  used to create and manage a Python virtual environment any project.

- **artifacts/**: Store model artifacts and other output files here.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and experimentation.

- **logs/**: Log files and output from your ML pipeline.

- **src/**: Source code for your MLOps project.

  - **logger.py**: Logging utilities for tracking project activity.
  - **exception.py**: Custom exception handling.
  - **utils.py**: Utility functions.
  - **__init__.py**: Initialization for the source package.

  - **components/**: Custom components for your MLOps pipeline.

    - **data_ingestion.py**: Data loading and preprocessing.
    - **data_transformation.py**: Data transformation and feature engineering.
    - **model_training.py**: Model training and evaluation.

  - **pipelines/**: ML pipeline definition.

    - **__init__.py**: Initialization for the pipelines package.
    - **prediction_pipeline.py**: Pipeline for model prediction.
    - **training_pipeline.py**: Pipeline for model training.

- **images/**: Image assets, such as project visuals and diagrams.

- **requirements.txt**: Python package dependencies for your project.

- **setup.py**: Setup script for your Python package.

- **app.py**: Main application file for running your MLOps processes.

- **Dockerfile**: Docker configuration for containerizing your project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to exclude from version control.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this template repository to start your MLOps project.
2. Customize the source code, components, and pipelines to fit your machine learning workflow.
3. Use the notebooks for data exploration and experimentation.
4. Define and train your machine learning models.
5. Containerize your project using Docker for reproducibility.
6. Develop your MLOps pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
